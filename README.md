### DESCRIPTION
In the real-time chat app, I used **Vite + React** for building the frontend, enabling fast development and a dynamic user interface. **TailwindCSS** and **DaisyUI** were used for creating a responsive and modern design with pre-styled components. For real-time communication, I integrated **Socket.IO client** on the frontend. On the backend, **Express.js** was used to handle API requests and server routing, while **MongoDB** stored user data and chat messages. **Cloudinary** was utilized for storing and managing image uploads, and **Socket.IO** was also used on the backend to enable real-time messaging capabilities.

### Features:
The app offers real-time messaging, allowing users to chat instantly without refreshing the page. It supports user authentication, so users can log in, access their personal chat history, and send messages. Image uploads are integrated, letting users share photos directly in the chat, with images stored on Cloudinary. The responsive UI, designed with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI, adapts to various screen sizes for a smooth experience on mobile and desktop devices.
